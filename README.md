# TODO

- Make the whole thing as a website.
- This app will have options:

    - watermark a whole word document (also, pdf in future)
    - watermark a whole directory.
	- watermark a zipped file (real zip, not word)
	- customize watermark --> upload an image as a watermark (fixed on)
	- move the watermark on the image (live)
	- make a fixed watermark
